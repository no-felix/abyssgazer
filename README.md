# AbyssGazer

A procedurally generated cave dungeon crawler where players descend into ever-deepening dimensions as dangers intensify with each level.

## 🎮 Game Concept

Players venture into a mysterious, ever-deepening cave system or dimensional rift. As you descend further into the abyss, the environment becomes increasingly hostile:

- **Deeper = Deadlier**: Each level down brings stronger enemies and greater challenges
- **Resource Scarcity**: Essential supplies become scarcer as you progress
- **Ultimate Challenge**: Survive and descend as deep as possible before meeting your inevitable demise

## ✨ Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Procedural Generation**: Every room is dynamically generated, ensuring no two runs are identical
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Enemies become stronger and more numerous with each level
- **Resource Management**: Carefully manage dwindling supplies as resources become increasingly rare
- **Survival Challenge**: Test your limits - how deep can you go before you're overwhelmed?

### Planned Features
- Diverse enemy types with unique behaviors per depth level
- Environmental hazards that increase in severity
- Loot and equipment system with risk/reward mechanics
- Atmospheric audio and visual effects that intensify with depth
- Leaderboard system to track deepest successful descents

## 🎯 Vision

AbyssGazer aims to capture the essence of classic dungeon crawlers while introducing modern procedural generation techniques. The core philosophy is simple: the deeper you go, the more dangerous it becomes, but the greater the potential rewards.

The abyss gazes back at those who dare to look into it. How deep will you venture?
